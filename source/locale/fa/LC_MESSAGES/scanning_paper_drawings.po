"**Black and white** scanning gives you the most immediate results, and "
"fewer parameters need to be set. Once a **Threshold:** value is set, "
"pixels of the scanned image are considered as either black or white. Due "
"to the simplicity of this concept, less time is required to scan the "
"image, and scanned files are lighter to manage. Even if images show hard "
"edges, the proper antialiasing will be added during the cleanup process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scanning_paper_drawings.rst:81
msgid ""
"**Greyscale** scanning, being based on a range of grey values, requires a"
" longer scanning time. Determining **Brightness:** and **Contrast:** "
"parameters depends considerably on the individual animated sequence and "

"**Autoadjust** options during the cleanup process, useful to even the "

"outline in black and its body shadow in red or in blue. As colored lines "
"can be identified later during the cleanup process, scanning colored "

"poor quality result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid using *black* or *colored* paper reinforcements around the pegbar "
"holes in your drawing sheets. The scanner has to read the exact shape of "
"the hole punches, and colored reinforcements may cause holes to be "
"scanned larger than their actual size. If you do use *white* "

"rest of your drawings. Lines drawn near the pegbar holes may cause the "
